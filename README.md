# FizzBuzz

This is a standard children's game in which:

1) On every third number, fizz is said.

2) On every fifth number, buzz is said.

3) On the crossing of the two, fizzbuzz is said


Generally this goes to 100, but there will be 3 baby steps, and more to follow. 

-Create the loop to state the numbers and words. COMPLETED

-Create the loop to stop the loop at 100. COMPLETED

-Create an input for where to start and where to stop(rather than from 1-100). Also a user interface to choose to play or see the full list from start to finish COMPLETED

-A timer will be implemented later to add more... INTENSITY
